	<h1 class="head1">I’m “wife”—I’ve finished that (1863)</h1>
	<h2 class="head2">by Emily Dickinson</h2>
	<p class="paragraph2">
	I’m “wife”—I’ve finished that—</br>
	That other state—</br>
	I’m Czar—I’m “Woman” now—</br>
	It’s safer so—</br>
	How odd the Girl’s life looks</br>
	Behind this soft Eclipse—</br>
	I think that Earth feels so</br>
	To folks in Heaven—now—</br>
	This being comfort—then</br>
	That other kind—was pain—</br>
	But why compare?</br>
	I’m “Wife”! Stop there!</br>

	<h1 class="head1">Still I Rise (1978)</h1>
	<h2 class="head2">by Maya Angelou</h2>
	<p class="paragraph2">
	You may write me down in history </br>
	With your bitter, twisted lies,</br>
	You may trod me in the very dirt</br>
	But still, like dust, I’ll rise.</br>

	Does my sassiness upset you?</br>
	Why are you beset with gloom?</br>
	’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells</br>
	Pumping in my living room.</br>
	Just like moons and like suns,</br>
	With the certainty of tides,</br>
	Just like hopes springing high,</br>
	Still I’ll rise.</br>

	Did you want to see me broken?</br>
	Bowed head and lowered eyes?</br>
	Shoulders falling down like teardrops,</br>
	Weakened by my soulful cries?</br>

	Does my haughtiness offend you?</br>
	Don’t you take it awful hard</br>
	’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines</br>
	Diggin’ in my own backyard.</br>

	You may shoot me with your words,</br>
	You may cut me with your eyes,</br>
	You may kill me with your hatefulness,</br>
	But still, like air, I’ll rise.</br>

	Does my sexiness upset you?</br>
	Does it come as a surprise</br>
	That I dance like I’ve got diamonds</br>
	At the meeting of my thighs?</br>

	Out of the huts of history’s shame</br>
	I rise</br>
	Up from a past that’s rooted in pain</br>
	I rise</br>
	I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,</br>
	Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</br>

	Leaving behind nights of terror and fear</br>
	I rise</br>
	Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear</br>
	I rise</br>
	Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</br>
	I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</br>
	I rise</br>
	I rise</br>
	I rise.</br>

	<h1 class="head1">For Women Who Are Difficult to Love (2011)</h1>
	<h2 class="head2">by Warsan Shire</h2>
	<p class="paragraph2">
	you are a horse running alone</br>
	and he tries to tame you</br>
	compares you to an impossible highway</br>
	to a burning house</br>
	says you are blinding him</br>
	that he could never leave you</br>
	forget you</br>
	want anything but you</br>
	you dizzy him, you are unbearable</br>
	every woman before or after you</br>
	is doused in your name</br>
	you fill his mouth</br>
	his teeth ache with memory of taste</br>
	his body just a long shadow seeking yours</br>
	but you are always too intense</br>
	frightening in the way you want him</br>
	unashamed and sacrificial</br>
	he tells you that no man can live up to the one who</br>
	lives in your head</br>
	and you tried to change didn’t you?</br>
	closed your mouth more</br>
	tried to be softer</br>
	prettier</br>
	less volatile, less awake</br>
	but even when sleeping you could feel</br>
	him travelling away from you in his dreams</br>
	so what did you want to do love</br>
	split his head open?</br>
	you can’t make homes out of human beings</br>
	someone should have already told you that</br>
	and if he wants to leave</br>
	then let him leave</br>
	you are terrifying</br>
	and strange and beautiful</br>
	something not everyone knows how to love.</br>

	<h1 class="head1">Instructions on Not Giving Up (2018)</h1>
	<h2 class="head2">by Ada Limón</h2>
	<p class="paragraph2">
	More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out </br>
	of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s </br>
	almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving </br>
	their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate </br>
	sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees </br>
	that really gets to me. When all the shock of white </br>
	and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave </br>
	the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath, </br>
	the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin </br>
	growing over whatever winter did to us, a return </br>
	to the strange idea of continuous living despite </br>
	the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then, </br>
	I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf</br> 
	unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all. </br>
